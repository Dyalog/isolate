## isolate (for Dyalog v17.0)

Since version 14.0, Dyalog APL has included an *isolate* workspace, which enables simple asynchronous and
parallel programming in Dyalog APL. For development of enhancements targeting Dyalog version 17.0, the source 
for the isolate workspace was copied to GitHub from an internal SVN repository which will continue to be used until further notice for builds of Dyalog APL prior to v17.0.

## WARNING

Until further notice, this code is currently under significant reorganisation and development. It is neither stable nor fully functional. Do NOT replace your distributed *isolate* workspace with anything originating in this repository.
 
The "dyalog160" branch identifies the point at which the repostitory started to diverge from the SVN source.

## Documentation

Documentation for the futures and isolates can be found in the [Dyalog Documentation Centre](http://docs.dyalog.com/16.0/Parallel%20Language%20Features.pdf).
