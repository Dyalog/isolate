# isolate workspace

This is the source for the isolate workspace shipped with all installations of Dyalog APL since 14.0.
It provides access to futures and isolates, which enable simple asynchronous and
parallel programming in Dyalog APL. Complete documentation for this feature can be found 
in the [Dyalog Documentation Centre](http://docs.dyalog.com/16.0/Parallel%20Language%20Features.pdf).
