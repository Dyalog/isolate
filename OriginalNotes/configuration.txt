debug:
All public fns and ops set an error guard as:
     trapErr''::signal''
If options.debug is 0 (the default) then trapErr'' returns 0 so all errors are trapped and signalled back to the session.
If 1 then trapErr'' is ⍬, there is no trap and errors are signalled at the point of error.

drc:
If drc is # (the default) we check to see if #.DRC exists and copy if not. Otherwise drc must be a ref to the extant DRC namespace.

workspace:
This is the workspace to be ⎕LOADed by APLProcess (default "isolate") that must contain the isolate namespace and call 'isolate.ynys.isoStart ⍬' in its ⎕LX. It should be in one of the folders defined in [Options]-[Configure...]-[Workspace] in the session menubar or be specified with a full path.

listen:
Whether the isolates will be enabled to call back to the active ws to request further data &c. (default 0.)
When enabled an "instance" of RPCServer is created locally to receive requests from the isolates.
Such requests are issued to the "parent" of the remote isolate accessed as ##. which is enabled as an isolate in its own right.

processors:
The number of prosessors in the machine. Currently available from Windows but default 4 elsewhere.

processes:
The number of processes that will be started per prosessor in the machine. (default 1.)

runtime:
Whether the runtime equivalent of the active interpreter should be started for the slave processes. If the active interpreter (the default) is runtime then runtime anyway.

status:
Set by StartServer and AddServer.
